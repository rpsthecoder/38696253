<h2>How to clean and disinfect personal electronics</h2>

<p>Did you know germs live longer on sleek non-absorbent surfaces, like  electronics, than on surfaces like paper or cloth? </p>



<p>It’s important to clean and disinfect electronic items regularly. </p>


<p>Here are the steps for a thorough surface clean: </p>


<ol>
	<li>Use a soft-bristle brush or lens blower (or if you can be careful with, compressed air) to remove dust from the keyboard and other crevices. Hold the keyboard or  laptop upright while dusting so the dust falls on the work surface. </li>
	<li>Lightly mist a  microfibre cloth with water, or a solution that’s safe to use on electronics, and thoroughly wipe the surfaces, except the screen.</li>
	<li>For the screen, use a soft lint-free cloth, or a flat-weave microfibre, or a lens cloth, to wipe off the dust. If there’s grime, lightly mist the cloth with water and wipe. </li>
	<li>Take a disinfectant that’s safe to use on electronics, or make a homemade one by diluting a common household disinfectant (again, safe to use on electronics) with clean water and mist on a microfibre. <strong>Wipe the surfaces for at least a few seconds before buffing them dry.</strong></li></ol>

<p>Wash your hands before handling personal electronics. </p>

<p>Give one-minute window between shutting down the electronics and start cleaning it. </p>

<p>If you’re not worried about contamination, once a day clean with a dry microfibre cloth is adequate. Depending on how dirty your electronics get, you can perform all the cleaning steps once a week or month. </p>

<p>You can also use rubbing alcohol/ethanol to clean electronics, but test it on an inconspicuous spot first, because alcohol can strip any paint or protective coating from the surfaces. Work in a ventilated space. Ethanol is good for tough to remove grime on electronics, like sticker residue. </p>
